=== Q1: How did you structure your transmit implementation? In particular,
=== what do you do if the transmit ring is full?
Driver initially sets the DD bits for all tx descriptors.
While transmitting a package, driver checks current E1000_TDT DD bit:
If set, clears the DD bit in current tail desc, copies the data to kernel 
buffer, sets the length and increments the tail.
Otherwise, returns -E_E1000_TX_RING_FULL.
The network env output process holds an additional ring queue of pkt buffers,
and waits for either NSREQ_OUTPUT or NSREQ_TIMER.
For every NSREQ_OUTPUT, if output env queue is empty, it first tries to send 
the packet directly to the driver, if -E_E1000_TX_RING_FULL (or queue wasn't 
empty to begin with), the packet is pushed into the queue, tail is incremented 
and output env tries to send the packets between head and tail to the driver.
While sending packets, if driver returns -E_E1000_TX_RING_FULL, the output env
stops trying to send packets and returns to ipc_recv state and waits for events.
For every NSREQ_TIMER event the output simply tries to send the packets between 
head and tail (again stops on first -E_E1000_TX_RING_FULL returned from driver).
If all queues are full (tail reached head in output env), panic.

=== Q2: How did you structure your receive implementation? In particular, what
=== do you do if the receive queue is empty and a user environment requests the
=== next incoming packet?
Driver activates e1000s irq line in pic and sets the E1000_ICR_RXT0 bit in 
E1000_IMS, also trap gate is initialized for IRQ_E1000 in kern/trap.c.
When user env uses the tcp_recv system call, the system call code first tries
to read packet from e1000 recieve queue (using driver of course),
if there is a packet available, this packet is copied to the user env,
otherwise, the request is registered in environments struct Env, and the 
environment is set to ENV_NOT_RUNNABLE.
Registered fields include bool env_tcp_recving, void *env_tcp_dstva, uint32_t
env_tcp_buff_size, int *env_tcp_dstlen.
When an IRQ_E1000 interrupt arrives, trap code scans all environments looking
for an env which has env_tcp_recving flag on, if found, writes the packet data
to the buffer and len pointers supplied by the environment and sets the 
environment ENV_RUNNABLE, otherwise, silently does nothing.
This way, when there are packets in the recieve queue, they are immediatly
returned to the user env, otherwise, user env hangs until the interrupt
arrives.
Network server holds a queue of receiving buffers, so that it doesn't overwrite
previously unprocessed buffers.
Additionally, input helper env forks another env - a keep_alive env.
This env runs: while(1) sys_yield(); and is meant to prevent the scheduler
from halting the system in case all environments are set as ENV_NOT_RUNNABLE.
This can happen, for example, in the supplied test cases, where the testinput
waits for IPC, in ENV_NOT_RUNNABLE state, and the output env waits for incoming
packets, also in ENV_NOT_RUNNABLE state.
If keep alive env was not created and a scheduler tick were to occur before a
new packet arrived, it would iterate over all the environments and would not
find a RUNNABLE env, causing the scheduler to call sched_halt(), ultimately
killing the system.

=== Q3: What does the web page served by JOS's web server say?
This file came from JOS.
Cheesy web page!

=== Q4: How long approximately did it take you to do this lab?
About 30 hours

=== Challenge description:
We chose to load the E1000's MAC address out of the EEPROM.
We do this by storing an array of bytes called e1000_hwaddr[6], this array is
initialized with the e1000 hwaddr in the following way:
During e1000_init() we use a utility function 
static int e1000_eeprom_r(uint8_t addr)
to read addresses 0x0,0x1,0x2 from the EEPROM.
What this function does is write the addr and start bit in the E1000_EERD 
register, and then waits in a loop for the E1000_EEPROM_RW_REG_DONE bit to be
asserted.
The data is then read from the same register and returned to the caller.
Also, a systemcall "static void sys_e100_get_hwaddr(uint8_t buffer[6])" was
added to be able to get the hwaddr from user space.
lwIP's low_level_init was also changed and now uses this system call instead
of the hard-coded MAC address.
